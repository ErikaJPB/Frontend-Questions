/**
 * The function finds the corresponding node in tree2 for a given node in tree1 by traversing both

 * @param tree2 - Unfortunately, the parameter for `tree2` is missing from the code snippet provided.
 * Can you please provide the value of `tree2` so I can assist you better?
 * @param node1 - The node in the first tree that we want to find the corresponding node for in the
 * second tree.
 * @returns the corresponding node in `tree2` that corresponds to the input `node1` in `tree1`.
